# Grovers-Algorithm
This project implements Groverâ€™s Algorithm using Qiskit to solve constraint satisfaction problems represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). It includes:

-- Construction of Bitflip and Phase Oracles from CNF clauses

-- A custom Grover operator for multi-iteration search

-- Quantum counting circuits to estimate the number of valid solutions

-- A Python-based driver to parse CSV-based constraints and execute the quantum algorithm
